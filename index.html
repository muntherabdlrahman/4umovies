<p> Theaters are cautiously reopening, Cannes is back on the calendar (with fingers crossed) for July, and jittery studios have been shuffling around release dates for all the blockbusters that were bumped from last year. In other words: Movies are back, baby! Though, of course, they never really went away. Even in these early months of 2021, streaming and on-demand releases have offered up a slew of treasures worth seeking out, from a tender documentary about stray dogs on the streets of Istanbul to a delirious Kristen Wiig comedy about two Midwestern women finding themselves (and stopping an archvillain) while vacationing in Florida. Here are the best movies Vulture has seen and, in many cases, reviewed so far this year, according to critics Bilge Ebiri and Alison Willmore.</p>
